All through the pandemic, faculty and students alike have struggled to create the genuine connections and rich dialogues that happen when everyone’s in a room together. Technical challenges range from random computer glitches to missing out on important bits of the lecture when the WiFi fades. Zoom fatigue spares no one. And with everything on the computer, professors need new tools to make sure their learning environments are fair, which requires an ability for those who use testing to prevent and catch cheating. </p>\\n<p>Some university administrators believed they’d found a solution to this last concern by contracting with virtual proctoring companies like, say, ExamSoft, which was founded in 1998. Since then, it has <a class=\\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\\" href=\\"https://examsoft.com/why-examsoft\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\" target=\\"_blank\\">administered 75,000,000 exams</a>, according to the company website. </p>\\n<div class=\\"pb2 mw-v20 center db pa3-ns fl-ns\\">\\n<picture>\\n<source data-srcset=\\"compressed/images/messages.webp\\" type=\\"image/webp\\">\\n<source data-srcset=\\"compressed/images/messages.jpg\\" type=\\"image/jpeg\\">\\n    <img data-src=\\"images/messages.jpg\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" class=\\"db w-100 lazyload\\" alt=\\"Jack Schutte, a first-year student at UC Santa Cruz, shared his experience over text with YR Media during his first time taking an exam with ProctorU.

Another large-scale virtual proctoring service is ProctorU, which reported proctoring over 5,000,000 exams. Jarrod Morgan, founder and chief strategy officer of ProctorU, told YR Media: “We feel very strongly that we should protect the education industry and the integrity of exams.”</p>\\n<p>“The pandemic put everyone in a situation where they had to use this,” Morgan said of virtual proctoring. “Nothing really changed about our service, but the fact that we were not really an option in 2020: we were a requirement to continue to work.”</p>\\n<p>I’m a freshman virtually attending classes at University of California at Santa Cruz, and I’ve heard lots of stories from students using proctoring software for tests. By and large, the chatter amongst my friends hasn’t been good. I spent several months looking into the rise of various virtual proctoring companies, the effects they’re having on students, and whether, in the eyes of students, the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>\\n<p>Students I spoke with reported that using proctoring software added significant anxiety to the already-stressful situation of taking a high-stakes test, and that the anxiety could affect their performance. Many also expressed concern that these companies violated their rights in one way or another. Some raised issues related to digital privacy, others about racial and other forms of bias within the technology. Our data analysis of 79 Change.org petitions against virtual proctoring software in the United States echoed these themes. Petitions were launched across 28 states. Privacy — mentioned in 72 of the 79 petitions — was the issue cited the most.

He used ProctorU to take an exam for his calculus class. He and I are close friends.</p>\\n<p>The first thing Schutte had to do before he could take his test was download a ProctorU extension on Chrome. Schutte became uneasy as soon as he read the <a class=\\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\\" href=\\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proctoru/goobgennebinldhonaajgafidboenlkl\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\" target=\\"_blank\\">extension’s permissions</a>, which included the ability during the test for ProctorU to “read and change all your data on the websites you visit,” “read and modify data you copy and paste,” “detect your physical location,” and “capture the content of your screen.” </p>\\n<p>“Between taking control of someone’s computer [and] reading and accessing all of your data ... it feels like someone [could] exploit the university’s use of ProctorU for nefarious ends,” Schutte said.</p>\\n<p>Because Schutte was using a product that included live proctoring, unlike Beaubrun and Been Khan, he could actually talk to the person who had control over his entire computer during the exam time. When the proctor asked for permission to take control, Schutte said he felt nervous. </p>\\n<p>Having an “outside proctor to monitor you, in your own living space... if ... there was an actual person that came and sat in your home and watched you take your test ... You feel like they\'re expecting you to cheat. They just want someone there to catch it when it happens,” Schutte said. But he went along with it anyway. “It was my exams,” he said. “I couldn’t exactly refuse at that point.”</p>\\n<p>UCSC covered the cost of Schutte’s exam, but that’s not the case at all universities. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, for example, listed ProctorU costing between $16 and $38 per exam, depending on length, with late fees that could run between $8 and $12 if you don’t reserve your ProctorU appointment at least three days in advance. Jaylyn Stubbs, a teaching assistant from Louisiana State University, expressed concern for low-income students already struggling to stay afloat.\\n“It\'s kind of unfair,” Stubbs said. “For the students that can\'t really afford it, I don\'t feel like it\'s fair that they have to come out of pocket to take a test.”</p>\\n<div class=\\"pb2 mw-v20 center\\">\\n<video poster=\\"images/tiktokposter.jpg\\" playsinline=\\"\\" controlslist=\\"nodownload\\" controls=\\"\\" class=\\"w-100 custom-border\\"><source type=\\"video/mp4\\" src=\\"https://yri-projects-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/surveillanceu/13174277451.mp4\\"></video>\\n<div class=\\"f7 black  lh-solid pt1\\"><p class=\\"ma0\\">\\n</p><div><b><a href=\\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jayeboogie_/video/6935881923839462662\\" aria-label=\\"Tiktok\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\" target=\\"_blank\\">jayeboogie_</a></b>Jalynn 🤎 · 3-4</div>\\nI am MIND BLOWN 🤯 It’s bad enough that some of can’t really afford to attend school in the first place 😤 #fyp #college #hbcu #pwi\\n<p></p>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked for comment on Stubb’s concern, LSU told YR Media that faculty members are required to communicate costs to students in syllabuses at the beginning of the semester, and that the university offers “other primary assessment options.” Professors opt for ProctorU when “they feel that this is the best and only virtual route to assess the student during these times,” Alison Lee Satake, the Associate Director of Research at Louisiana State University, wrote in an email.</p>\\n<p>Universities that have added or extended use of these services during the pandemic have also done so at a cost — literally. \\nTake my own university.

Talha Sarfraz Ahmad and Mohamed Amine Bouftas are trying to bring about change at Purdue University by using the power of student government to push back against virtual proctoring services. </p>\\n<p>Ahmad was spurred to action by an experience he had with Respondus. He said that when he first tried to use it, Respondus locked him out of his iPad for eight hours.

He described virtual proctoring software as “a troublesome service … that we should be highly suspicious of.”</p>\\n<p>However, Andrew Roderick, assistant vice president of academic technology at SFSU, said the resolution is non-binding and is not policy. He knew of one program that used proctoring software on its culminating exam required for graduation.</p>\\n<p>Roderick said in an email, “Based on their experience using remote proctoring software, they are unlikely to use it in the future as it presented a number of logistical and technical challenges to the group of students participating in the exam.”</p>\\n<p>The resolutions passed by student governments and faculty are usually not obligatory, and universities make exceptions to use virtual third-party proctoring for certain programs.
