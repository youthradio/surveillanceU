All through the pandemic, faculty and students alike have struggled to create the genuine connections and rich dialogues that more easily take hold when everyone’s in a room together. Technical challenges range from random computer glitches to missing out on important bits of the lecture when the WiFi fades. Zoom fatigue spares no one. And of course, with everything on the computer, professors need new tools to make sure their learning environments are fair, which requires an ability to prevent and catch cheating on tests. </p>\n<img class=\"lazyload center db fn fl-ns pa3 nl5-ns\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/msgs.jpg\">\nSome university administrators believed they’d found a solution to this last concern by contracting with virtual proctoring companies like, say, Examsoft, which was founded in 1998. Since then, it has [proctored 75,000,000 exams](https://examsoft.com/why-examsoft), according to the company website. \n\n<p>Examsoft isn’t the only such product on the market. Another large-scale virtual proctoring service is ProctorU, which reported proctoring over 5,000,000 exams. Jarrod Morgan, CEO of ProctorU, told YR Media: “We feel very strongly that we should protect the education industry and the integrity of exams.”</p>\n<p>When the pandemic hit and campuses closed, universities needed to move fast to accommodate their new reality. Before 2020, students would take tests in the same room, and the professor, a teaching assistant, or some other in-person human proctor could be there to collect exams and check in if necessary. Remote learning left universities that normally operated on campus with fewer options. “The pandemic put everyone in a situation where they had to use this,” Jarrod Morgan said of virtual proctoring. “Nothing really changed about our service, but the fact that we were not really an option in 2020: we were a requirement to continue to work.”</p>\n<p>I’m a freshman virtually attending classes at University of California at Santa Cruz, and I’ve heard lots of stories from students using proctoring software for tests. By and large, the chatter among my friends has not been good. </p>\n<p>Conversations like these about the sheer invasiveness of the software inspired me to spearhead this investigation. I spent several months looking into the rise of various virtual proctoring companies, the effects they’re having on students, and whether the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p>Students I spoke with reported that using proctoring software added significant anxiety to the already-stressful situation of taking a high-stakes test, and that the anxiety could affect their performance. Many also expressed concern that these companies violated their rights in one way or another. Some raised issues related to digital privacy, others about racial and other forms of bias within the technology. Our data analysis of over 80 Change.org petitions against virtual proctoring software in the United States revealed these same themes.</p>","slug":"the-rise-of-virtual-proctoring-in-the-pandemic"},{"title":"How Virtual Proctoring Works","block":"infographic-proctoring","level":"2","text":"<p>The variety of online proctoring services on the market today is vast.

He used ProctorU to take an exam for his calculus class. Full disclosure: he and I are close friends.</p>\n<p>The first thing Schutte had to do before he could take his test was download a ProctorU extension on Chrome. Schutte became uneasy as soon as he read the <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proctoru/goobgennebinldhonaajgafidboenlkl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">extension’s permissions</a>, which included the ability during the test for ProctorU to “read and change all your data on the websites you visit,” “read and modify data you copy and paste,” “detect your physical location,” and “capture the content of your screen.” </p>\n<p>Because Schutte was using a product that included live proctoring, unlike Beaubrun and Been Khan, he could actually talk to the person who had control over his entire computer during the exam time. When the proctor asked for permission to take control of his computer, Schutte said he felt nervous. But “it was my exam,” he said. “So it wasn’t like I could say no at that point.”</p>\n<p>UCSC covered the cost of Schutte’s exam. But not all universities cover exam costs. For some students, the frustration also includes having to pay for the software which can run <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://online.illinois.edu/proctoru#:~:text=Exams%20proctored%20through%20ProctorU%20cost,when%20you%20schedule%20the%20exam.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$16-38 </a>an exam depending on its length; there can be late fees between $8-12 if you don’t reserve your ProctorU appointment at least three days in advance.

Between 2016-2019 the university approved $67,600 in fees to ProctorU, according to purchase orders YR Media obtained through public record requests.  </p>\n<p>When the coronavirus hit, UCSC’s Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee authorized a major uptick in spending on ProctorU for the main campus during the 2020-21 school year: a total of $200,000. </p>\n<p>Lee signed agreements that accompanied the $200,000 purchase order. He couldn’t tell us which part of UCSC’s budget was used to cover the software costs and would not confirm how much ProctorU has actually invoiced for. “A lot of things happen behind the scenes,” Lee said, “I wasn’t a part of exactly which type of funding was used for this.” </p>\n<p>Compared to other universities in the UC system, UCSC’s $200,000 in authorized spending on ProctorU was a lot of money. UC Santa Barbara, a slightly larger school, authorized spending around $60,000 on ProctorU from March 2021 to June 2021, according to public records requests. </p>\n<p>Given the problems with proctoring software, plus the anxiety it can cause, I began to wonder: what if some of that $200,000 had gone towards programs in order to better provide mental health services to students struggling during the pandemic?\nBased on YR Media’s <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/13/779015105/social-media-has-become-a-place-to-talk-about-mental-illness-but-is-that-helpful\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">prior reporting</a> for NPR —we know that even before the pandemic, universities were grappling with how to provide vital mental health services to students, and during the pandemic, students were <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-the-pandemic-is-impacting-college-students-mental-health\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">expirencing mental health issues at even higer rate</a> while universities contiued to struggle to provide all the necessary services.

Talha Sarfraz Ahmad and Mohamed Amine Bouftas are trying to bring about change at Purdue University by using the power of student government to push back against virtual proctoring services. </p>\n<p>Ahmad was spurred to action by an experience he had with Respondus. He said that when he first tried to use it, Respondus locked him out of his iPad for eight hours. To make matters worse, because all of his notes were on that iPad, Ahmad had to rush to the student library to print out his notes. YR found that out of 80 petitions on Change.org, 33 petitions made complaints against Respondus.</p>\n<p>Ahmad was infuriated. With Bouftas’ help, they drafted a resolution against virtual proctoring services at Purdue. </p>\n<p>Ahmad said, “I would argue that using these ... built a lot of suspicion between professors and students. And when so many people fall into problems like being falsely flagged for cheating or things like that, it makes me wonder, like, is this really achieving the objective of education?”</p>\n<p>Apart from his personal frustrations with Respondus, Ahmad has broader concerns about virtual proctoring. For example, he brought up concerns that virtual proctoring companies are outsourcing cheap labor abroad. YR was able to confirm this phenomenon through LinkedIn searches that turned up proctors in countries such as the Philippines and Mexico. </p>\n<p>Students aren’t the only ones taking a stand against virtual proctoring services. Some colleges discourage it. The Academic Senate at San Francisco State University (SFSU) <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://senate.sfsu.edu/resolution/resolution-third-party-proctoring\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">passed a resolution</a> that makes a case to restrict or ban the use of third-party proctoring. “Third-party remote proctoring is expressly designed to minimize cheating and rarely provides any student support,” the resolution states. “This casts faculty in the role of police catching cheaters, rather faculty acting as mentors to facilitate student success.”</p>\n<p>SFSU Professor Dr. Jackson Wilson, the vice chair of the academic senate at SFSU, helped author the SFSU resolution after hearing multiple concerns from students and faculty. He described virtual proctoring software as “a troublesome service … that we should be highly suspicious of.”</p>\n<p>However, Andrew Roderick, assistant vice president of academic technology at SFSU, said the resolution is non-binding and is not policy. He knows of one program that uses proctoring software on its culminating exam required for graduation.</p>\n<p>Roderick said in an email, “Based on their experience using remote proctoring software, they are unlikely to use it in the future as it presented a number of logistical and technical challenges to the group of students participating in the exam.”</p>\n<p>The resolutions passed by student governments and faculty are usually not obligatory, and universities make exceptions to use virtual third-party proctoring for certain programs. CSU Office of the Chancellor wrote a <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://www.csusm.edu/dos/documents/amw_to_provosts_vpsa_vpbf_online_proctoring_8.4.20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">memorandum</a> asking campus leaders to address concerns with virtual proctoring but stopped short of banning the software. UCSB Faculty Association made a similar gesture by writing a letter asking the university to curb the use of ProctorU (which the university appears to have ignored).</p>\n<p>Filing a petition online is another popular tactic for making a statement against virtual proctoring software, and sometimes it works.
