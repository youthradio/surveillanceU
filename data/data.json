All through the pandemic, faculty and students alike have struggled to create the genuine connections and rich dialogues that more easily take hold when everyone’s in a room together. Technical challenges range from random computer glitches to missing out on important bits of the lecture when the WiFi fades. Zoom fatigue spares no one. And of course, with everything on the computer, professors need new tools to make sure their learning environments are fair, which requires an ability to prevent and catch cheating on tests. </p>\n<p>Some university administrators believed they’d found a solution to this last concern by contracting with virtual proctoring companies like, say, Examsoft, which was founded in 1998. Since then, it has <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://examsoft.com/why-examsoft\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">proctored 75,000,000 exams</a>, according to the company website. </p>\n<p>Examsoft isn’t the only such product on the market. Another large-scale virtual proctoring service is ProctorU, which reported proctoring over 5,000,000 exams. Jarrod Morgan, CEO of ProctorU, told YR Media: “We feel very strongly that we should protect the education industry and the integrity of exams.”</p>\n<p>When the pandemic hit and campuses closed, universities needed to move fast to accommodate their new reality. Before 2020, students would take tests in the same room, and the professor, a teaching assistant, or some other in-person human proctor could be there to collect exams and check in if necessary. Remote learning left universities that normally operated on campus with fewer options. “The pandemic put everyone in a situation where they had to use this,” Jarrod Morgan said of virtual proctoring. “Nothing really changed about our service, but the fact that we were not really an option in 2020: we were a requirement to continue to work.”</p>\n<p>I’m a freshman virtually attending classes at University of California at Santa Cruz, and I’ve heard lots of stories from students using proctoring software for tests. By and large, the chatter among my friends has not been good. </p>\n<p>Conversations like these about the sheer invasiveness of the software inspired me to spearhead this investigation. I spent several months looking into the rise of various virtual proctoring companies, the effects they’re having on students, and whether the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p>Students I spoke with reported that using proctoring software added significant anxiety to the already-stressful situation of taking a high-stakes test, and that the anxiety could affect their performance. Many also expressed concern that these companies violated their rights in one way or another. Some raised issues related to digital privacy, others about racial and other forms of bias within the technology. Our data analysis of over 80 Change.org petitions against virtual proctoring software in the United States revealed these same themes.</p>","slug":"the-rise-of-virtual-proctoring-in-the-pandemic"},{"title":"How Virtual Proctoring Works","level":"2","text":"<p>The variety of online proctoring services on the market today is vast.

ExamMonitor, a second product, <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://examsoft.com/solutions/exam-monitor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">records video and audio of students all through the test-taking experience</a> before uploading the footage to a third-party proctoring service that uses automated intelligence to monitor data including gaze, eye movements and sound. A (human) professional from Examsoft can then sift through behaviors, flag any unusual behavior and decide if they are punishable, “giving the institution the final review,” according to the <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://examsoft.com/solutions/exam-monitor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ExamSoft website</a>.

ProctorU CEO Morgan said live proctors can make active interventions. For example, if a test-taker is “constantly looking out the window,” Morgan said, the proctor can remind the student: “’Hey, I need you to keep your focus here.’ It could be [the student] picking up their cell phone or could be something as flagrant as picking up an answer key.”</p>","slug":"proctoru"},{"title":"Respondus","level":"3","text":"<p>Finally, Respondus, while not involving any proctors, purports to preserve academic integrity by shutting down a student’s ability to switch tabs, ostensibly preventing them from looking up answers online.

Areeb Been Khan, another student attempting to take his bar exam, told YR Media that it took five business days before Examsoft recognized his face at all. “That was anxiety inducing and it made it difficult to study information that was going to impact my livelihood,” Been Khan said. ExamSoft issued an email to Been Khan: if he failed to get the software to detect his face by the deadline, that could affect his registration status to sit for the exam.</p>\n<img>\n\n<p>Been Khan said he emailed Examsoft on a Monday, got a written response on a Wednesday, and when that wasn’t sufficient, he called customer support Friday morning but couldn’t get through because of a long wait. After selecting the option of an automated call back, he finally received help Friday evening.</p>\n<p>Been Khan said that when customer service called him back, an associate made changes that eventually permitted him to take the test. “He said straight up … ‘sometimes our program just needs like an updated data set … like a baseline for your face,’ which proves to me that they didn’t have a baseline for my face,” Been Khan said. “There's racism in technology, and that's kind of just what it comes down to, at least for me.”</p>\n<img>\n\n<p>Big tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, all have a track record for creating Artificial Intelligence that carries a gender and racial bias, according to <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Joy Buolamwini</a>, an AI researcher working at MIT who has studied this phenomenon extensively.

Cheating would be really bad academically.” But as Kohlenberg learned some of the things ProctorU would require from her, she got increasingly worried. </p>\n<p>&lt;&gt;“My initial concern was security on my laptop. If they can take control on my computer, I have sensitive data on my computer. That would be serious if someone else got that. I have medical information and documents.

Talha Sarfraz Ahmad and Mohamed Amine Bouftas are trying to bring about change at Purdue University by using the power of student government to push back against virtual proctoring services. </p>\n<p>Ahmad was spurred to action by an experience he had with Respondus. He said that when he first tried to use it, Respondus locked him out of his iPad for eight hours. To make matters worse, because all of his notes were on that iPad, Ahmad had to rush to the student library to print out his notes. YR found that out of 80 petitions on Change.org, 33 petitions made complaints against Respondus.</p>\n<p>Ahmad was infuriated. With Bouftas’ help, they drafted a resolution against virtual proctoring services at Purdue. </p>\n<p>&lt;&gt;Ahmad said, “I would argue that using these ... built a lot of suspicion between professors and students. And when so many people fall into problems like being falsely flagged for cheating or things like that, it makes me wonder, like, is this really achieving the objective of education?”&lt;&gt;</p>\n<p>Apart from his personal frustrations with Respondus, Ahmad has broader concerns about virtual proctoring. For example, he brought up concerns that virtual proctoring companies are outsourcing cheap labor abroad. YR was able to confirm this phenomenon through LinkedIn searches that turned up proctors in countries such as the Philippines and Mexico. </p>\n<p>&lt;&gt;</p>\n<p>Students aren’t the only ones taking a stand against virtual proctoring services. Some colleges discourage it. The Academic Senate at San Francisco State University (SFSU) <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://senate.sfsu.edu/resolution/resolution-third-party-proctoring\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">passed a resolution</a> that makes a case to restrict or ban the use of third-party proctoring. “Third-party remote proctoring is expressly designed to minimize cheating and rarely provides any student support,” the resolution states. “This casts faculty in the role of police catching cheaters, rather faculty acting as mentors to facilitate student success.”</p>\n<p>SFSU Professor Dr. Jackson Wilson, the vice chair of the academic senate at SFSU, helped author the SFSU resolution after hearing multiple concerns from students and faculty. He described virtual proctoring software as “a troublesome service … that we should be highly suspicious of.”</p>\n<p>However, Andrew Roderick, assistant vice president of academic technology at SFSU, said the resolution is non-binding and is not policy. He knows of one program that uses proctoring software on its culminating exam required for graduation.</p>\n<p>Roderick said in an email, “Based on their experience using remote proctoring software, they are unlikely to use it in the future as it presented a number of logistical and technical challenges to the group of students participating in the exam.”</p>\n<p>The resolutions passed by student governments and faculty are usually not obligatory, and universities make exceptions to use virtual third-party proctoring for certain programs. CSU Office of the Chancellor wrote a <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://www.csusm.edu/dos/documents/amw_to_provosts_vpsa_vpbf_online_proctoring_8.4.20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">memorandum</a> asking campus leaders to address concerns with virtual proctoring but stopped short of banning the software. UCSB Faculty Association made a similar gesture by writing a letter asking the university to curb the use of ProctorU (which the university appears to have ignored).</p>\n<p>&lt;&gt;</p>\n<p>Filing a petition online is another popular tactic for making a statement against virtual proctoring software, and sometimes it works.
