All through the pandemic, faculty and students alike have struggled to create the genuine connections and rich dialogues that happen when everyone’s in a room together. Technical challenges range from random computer glitches to missing out on important bits of the lecture when the WiFi fades. Zoom fatigue spares no one. And with everything on the computer, professors need new tools to make sure their learning environments are fair, which requires an ability for those who use testing to prevent and catch cheating. </p>\n<p>Some university administrators believed they’d found a solution to this last concern by contracting with virtual proctoring companies like, say, Examsoft, which was founded in 1998. Since then, it has <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://examsoft.com/why-examsoft\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">proctored 75,000,000 exams</a>, according to the company website. </p>\n<div class=\"pb2 mw-v20 center db pa3-ns fl-ns\">\n    <img data-src=\"images/messages.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"db w-100 lazyload\">\n    <div class=\"f7 black  lh-solid pt1\">\n        <p class=\"ma0\">Jack Schutte, a first-year student at UC Santa Cruz, shared his experience over text with YR Media during his first time taking an exam with ProctorU.

In May 2020, Proctorio's Chief Executive Mike Olsen told the <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/us/online-testing-cheating-universities-coronavirus.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> that after campuses started going remote because of the pandemic, his virtual proctoring company grew 900 percent. Another large-scale virtual proctoring service is ProctorU, which reported proctoring over 5,000,000 exams. Jarrod Morgan, founder and chief strategy officer of ProctorU, told YR Media: “We feel very strongly that we should protect the education industry and the integrity of exams.”</p>\n<p>“The pandemic put everyone in a situation where they had to use this,” Morgan said of virtual proctoring. “Nothing really changed about our service, but the fact that we were not really an option in 2020: we were a requirement to continue to work.”</p>\n<p>I’m a freshman virtually attending classes at University of California at Santa Cruz, and I’ve heard lots of stories from students using proctoring software for tests. By and large, the chatter amongst my friends hasn’t been good. I spent several months looking into the rise of various virtual proctoring companies, the effects they’re having on students, and whether, in the eyes of students, the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p>Students I spoke with reported that using proctoring software added significant anxiety to the already-stressful situation of taking a high-stakes test, and that the anxiety could affect their performance. Many also expressed concern that these companies violated their rights in one way or another. Some raised issues related to digital privacy, others about racial and other forms of bias within the technology. Our data analysis of 79 Change.org petitions against virtual proctoring software in the United States echoed these themes. Petitions were launched across 28 states. Privacy — mentioned in 72 of the 79 petitions — was the issue cited the most. Over half of the petitions raised concerns that virtual proctoring drove inequality and damaged mental health:</p>","slug":"the-rise-of-virtual-proctoring-in-the-pandemic"},{"title":"How Virtual Proctoring Works","block":"infographic-proctoring","level":"2","text":"<p>The variety of online proctoring services on the market today is vast.

He used ProctorU to take an exam for his calculus class. He and I are close friends.</p>\n<p>The first thing Schutte had to do before he could take his test was download a ProctorU extension on Chrome. Schutte became uneasy as soon as he read the <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proctoru/goobgennebinldhonaajgafidboenlkl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">extension’s permissions</a>, which included the ability during the test for ProctorU to “read and change all your data on the websites you visit,” “read and modify data you copy and paste,” “detect your physical location,” and “capture the content of your screen.” </p>\n<p>“Between taking control of someone’s computer [and] reading and accessing all of your data ... it feels like someone [could] exploit the university’s use of ProctorU for nefarious ends,” Schutte said.</p>\n<p>Because Schutte was using a product that included live proctoring, unlike Beaubrun and Been Khan, he could actually talk to the person who had control over his entire computer during the exam time. When the proctor asked for permission to take control, Schutte said he felt nervous. </p>\n<p>Having an “outside proctor to monitor you, in your own living space... if ... there was an actual person that came and sat in your home and watched you take your test ... You feel like they're expecting you to cheat. They just want someone there to catch it when it happens,” Schutte said. But he went along with it anyway. “It was my exams,” he said. “I couldn’t exactly refuse at that point.”</p>\n<p>UCSC covered the cost of Schutte’s exam, but that’s not the case at all universities. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, for example, listed ProctorU costing between $16 and $38 per exam, depending on length, with late fees that could run between $8 and $12 if you don’t reserve your ProctorU appointment at least three days in advance. Jaylyn Stubbs, a teaching assistant from Louisiana State University, expressed concern for low-income students already struggling to stay afloat.\n“It's kind of unfair,” Stubbs said. “For the students that can't really afford it, I don't feel like it's fair that they have to come out of pocket to take a test.”</p>\n<div class=\"pb2 mw-v20 center\">\n<video poster=\"images/tiktokposter.jpg\" playsinline=\"\" controlslist=\"nodownload\" controls=\"\" class=\"w-100 custom-border\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://yri-projects-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/surveillanceu/13174277451.mp4\"></video>\n<div class=\"f7 black  lh-solid pt1\"><p class=\"ma0\">\n</p><div><b><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jayeboogie_/video/6935881923839462662\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">jayeboogie_</a></b>Jalynn 🤎 · 3-4</div>\nI am MIND BLOWN 🤯 It’s bad enough that some of can’t really afford to attend school in the first place 😤 #fyp #college #hbcu #pwi\n<p></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>When asked for comment on Stubb’s concern, LSU told YR Media that faculty members are required to communicate costs to students in syllabuses at the beginning of the semester, and that the university offers “other primary assessment options.” Professors opt for ProctorU when “they feel that this is the best and only virtual route to assess the student during these times,” Alison Lee Satake, the Associate Director of Research at Louisiana State University, wrote in an email.\nUniversities that have added or extended use of these services during the pandemic have also done so at a cost — literally. \nTake my own university. In the years prior to the pandemic, UCSC’s agreements with ProctorU were largely with the university’s off-campus UC Extension programming, based on purchase orders YR Media obtained through public record requests. Between 2016-2019, these records showed the university approved $67,600 in fees to ProctorU.  </p>\n<p>When the coronavirus hit, UCSC’s Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee authorized spending on ProctorU for the main campus during the 2020-21 school year, and for a lot more money: $200,000. </p>\n<p>Lee couldn’t tell us which part of UCSC’s budget was used to cover the software costs and said that he could not directly provide invoices from ProctorU that would confirm how much UCSC has spent to date on the software. “There was a lot of allocation that was done very quickly in response to the conversion to emergency remote instruction. A lot of things happen behind the scenes,” Lee said. “I wasn’t a part of exactly which type of funding was used for this.”</p>\n<div class=\"pb2 center\">\n   <img data-src=\"images/foia.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"db w-100 lazyload\">\n    <div class=\"f7 black  lh-solid pt1\">\n        <p class=\"ma0\">YR Media Journalist Zoe Harwood placed a FOIA request asking all UCs and CSUs for their vendor contracts with virtual proctoring companies.

The Academic Senate at San Francisco State University (SFSU) <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://senate.sfsu.edu/resolution/resolution-third-party-proctoring\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">passed a resolution</a> that makes a case to restrict or ban the use of third-party proctoring. “Third-party remote proctoring is expressly designed to minimize cheating and rarely provides any student support,” the resolution states. “This casts faculty in the role of police catching cheaters, rather [than] faculty acting as mentors to facilitate student success.”</p>\n<p>SFSU Professor Dr. Jackson Wilson, the vice chair of the academic senate at SFSU, helped author the SFSU resolution after hearing multiple concerns from students and faculty. He described virtual proctoring software as “a troublesome service … that we should be highly suspicious of.”</p>\n<p>However, Andrew Roderick, assistant vice president of academic technology at SFSU, said the resolution is non-binding and is not policy. He knew of one program that used proctoring software on its culminating exam required for graduation.</p>\n<p>Roderick said in an email, “Based on their experience using remote proctoring software, they are unlikely to use it in the future as it presented a number of logistical and technical challenges to the group of students participating in the exam.”</p>\n<p>The resolutions passed by student governments and faculty are usually not obligatory, and universities make exceptions to use virtual third-party proctoring for certain programs. California State University Office of the Chancellor wrote a <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://www.csusm.edu/dos/documents/amw_to_provosts_vpsa_vpbf_online_proctoring_8.4.20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">memorandum</a> asking campus leaders to address concerns with virtual proctoring but stopped short of banning the software. UCSB Faculty Association made a similar gesture by writing a letter asking the university to curb the use of ProctorU (which the university appears to have ignored).</p>\n<div class=\"pb2 center\">\n   <a class=\"dib grow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/averagediana/status/1250934038610636800\"><img data-src=\"images/tweediana.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"db w-100 lazyload\"></a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Filing a petition online is another popular tactic for making a statement against virtual proctoring software, and sometimes it works.  The City University of New York’s petition, <a class=\"link purple underline underline-hover hover-dark-purple\" href=\"https://www.change.org/p/chancellor-f%C3%A9lix-v-matos-rodr%C3%ADguez-do-not-let-cuny-violate-student-privacy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">“Do Not Let CUNY Violate Student Privacy,”</a> gained more than 28,000 signatures.

What are students asking for? </p>\n<p>Bouftas, who helped Ahmad draft a resolution against virtual proctoring at Purdue, suggested less invasive alternatives, such as virtual conferencing services already being used. “Another thing we tried to address is modifying the way assessments are given, so that cheating is harder to do,” Bouftas said.</p>\n<p>Mohamad Bouftas and Talha Ahmad continue to discuss the bill they passed with Purdue’s senate, sparking campuswide awareness of proctoring services and the impact they can have on students.
